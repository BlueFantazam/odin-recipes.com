      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Begova Čorba, also known as Bey’s Soup, is a traditional Bosnian chicken and okra soup rich in flavor and history.
        It’s a creamy, comforting dish often served as a starter at special occasions and holidays.
      </p>
      <p>
        The soup is slow-cooked with chicken, root vegetables, and okra, then thickened with a flour-egg-lemon mixture
        that gives it a velvety texture. Served hot with a slice of fresh bread, it’s a beloved part of Bosnian culinary heritage.
