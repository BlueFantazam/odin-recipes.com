        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Bosnian Ćevapi are small, grilled minced meat sausages served with warm somun (flatbread), chopped raw onions,
          and a dollop of kajmak (creamy dairy spread). They are a staple of Balkan street food and a must-try for anyone
          exploring traditional Bosnian cuisine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Made with a mixture of beef and lamb (or just beef), the meat is seasoned simply and grilled until juicy and charred.
          Ćevapi are often enjoyed wrapped in soft flatbread, making them perfect as a hearty lunch or dinner.
